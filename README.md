# Cricket-ODI-World-Cup-Analysis-in-Power-BI

     I created a Cricket ODI World Cup Analysis dashboard in Power BI using a dataset that includes information about batsmen, bowlers, and ODI match results. The data contained various statistics such as total runs, number of fours and sixes, total overs and wickets, number of matches won, match dates, stadium locations, and opponents. I followed these steps to create the dashboard: cleaning the csv data in Excel, creating a dataset table in Snowflake, and importing the data from Snowflake into Power BI. This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of the cricket world cup data.
